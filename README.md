# __*JavaScript/jQuery Agenda/Planner App*__

## Details About This Assignment
This homework was all about using what we had learned in the last two weeks about JavaScript and jQuery and putting it to the test, although we did not have to make the UI for this homework, it was still very challenging. Us as students had to create an app where the user could enter text into a textfield, save it and be able to close their browser and resume working on it where they left off at, and still have the same text on that same timeslot that they entered it into. There is also a timer in there that is refreshing every few minutes to update the timeslot colors if that time has either passed, current, or in the future.
